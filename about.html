    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <h3>Inspiration Behind YeromRecipe Hub</h3>
    <p>Our journey began in the cozy corners of our kitchens, amidst the clattering of pots and pans, and the aromatic allure of home-cooked meals. Fueled by our passion for food and technology, we embarked on creating the YeromRecipe Hub. What started as a conversation over a homemade meal, has now blossomed into a project that we are proud to present as part of our Portfolio Project for Holberton School.</p>
